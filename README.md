Current plan is to finish writing "chapter one" or "pilot chapter" (or whatever it could be considered), then go back and add variables and minor branching and changed text, then get that play tested/released while I start working on the rest. This is both to set reasonable goals for myself and have some sort of completed project even if it doesn't get farther than the first chapter, and to garner any interest or critiques.

The game is an interactive fiction made in Ink by Inkle, and will have choices that change both minor interactions and major character development. Jones, an Initiate playbook character from our Monster of the Week campaign (initially played by Kansas) will be the 2nd person perspective character the player will interact with the world through. Many of her choices will remain up to the player, but she still has her own concrete basis of background, interests, and personality, some of which will stay constant and some of which will slowly change with player decisions. The pilot chapter starts off with Jones at her first day of college, heading to her last class while trying not to worry about a vague and dreaded appointment coming up afterward. She runs into her friend from high school, Brigid (initially played by Anna with the Hex playbook), and realize they're in the same class together: Paranormal 101, a blow off class mostly used to fill the credit number requirement, and meets the very strange Professor Osbourne and fellow student-but-not, Felixe (initially played by Jackie (the primary creator of the game) with the Expert playbook).

The overall story will deal with questions of choice and destiny, justice and mercy, and what separates people from monsters.
